### Project Catch-Up Prompt

**Project:** Portfolio backend with Netlify serverless functions

**Current status:**

* Backend originally written as an Express server with endpoints `/sendProjectIdea` and `/contact-us`.
* Migrated backend logic into Netlify-compatible serverless functions (`sendProjectIdea.js` and `contactUs.js`).
* Static frontend assets (`index.html`, CSS, images) served by Netlify.
* File-based data storage implemented for local testing (`projectideaContact.json`, `contact-us.json`).
* Tested serverless functions locally with Netlify CLI.

**What works:**

* Basic POST routes to save project ideas and contact info in local JSON files.
* Frontend static files served correctly.
* Functions respond with appropriate success/error messages.

**Challenges / open questions:**

* File persistence: Netlify functions don’t support persistent local file writes in production.
* Need to select and integrate a persistent storage solution (database, cloud storage).
* Frontend integration with serverless functions (calling APIs, handling responses).
* Deployment pipeline and environment variables management if needed.
* Authentication, validation, or spam protection (optional enhancements).

**Next steps:**

1. Research and pick a suitable persistent storage backend (e.g., Firebase, MongoDB Atlas, Airtable).
2. Refactor serverless functions to read/write from the chosen database.
3. Connect frontend form submissions to serverless functions and handle UI feedback.
4. Add basic validation and error handling.
5. Test full deployment on Netlify.
6. Optional: Add authentication or admin view to manage submissions.

**Questions to clarify:**

* Do you want me to help implement database integration next?
* Should I assist with setting up frontend calls and UI interaction?
* Are there any additional backend features or routes you want to add?

If you want, I can also generate a detailed to-do list or a project timeline based on this!
